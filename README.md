# Coffee Can Radar

## Disclaimer
This is a work in progress! It may or (more likely) may not currently be in a functioning state. 

## Purpose

This project is inspired by the [MIT Coffee Can Radar](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-ll-003-build-a-small-radar-system-capable-of-sensing-range-doppler-and-synthetic-aperture-radar-imaging-january-iap-2011/). The purpose of this project is to get some exposure to RF PCB design by adapting the MIT Coffee Can radar to make use of tools that are readily available and familiar to the open source community.
